##Simple App Engine Flickr Backup##
----

After I read about that dude losing all his photos (http://www.observer.com/2011/tech/flickr-accidentally-deletes-users-4000-photos-and-cant-get-them-back) I decided that I wanted to backup all of my photos to another datastore. Something that I pay for and allows me to do some shit with them. 

I decided that I would push them into the Google App Engine blobstore. 

This is the result of about 4 hours of hacking. I used Straup's FlickrApp container (https://github.com/straup/gae-flickrapp) to jumpstart the app. It is a hacked up version of webapp framework to allow you to use flickr as your SSO. It is pretty awesome - but probably a bit of overload for this app. 

The app was built to be multitenant - but i haven't tested it extensively. 

There are some limitations to this that i need to get past, but for the most
